  <div>
      In the realm of code, where logic does reign,<br>
      A programmer sits, his mind a domain.<br>
      With lines of text, he weaves his creation,<br>
      A symphony of algorithms, a digital sensation.<br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
    He types away with fingers nimble,<br>
    A keyboard warrior, code's humble symbol.<br>
    Syntax errors, bugs, and endless loops,<br>
    But fear not, for our programmer never droops.<br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
    With a cup of coffee, his trusty sidekick,<br>
    He conquers bugs with a mighty click.<br>
    From dawn till dusk, he battles away,<br>
    In a world of functions and arrays.<br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
    He dreams in code, his mind does wander,<br>
    Through nested loops, his thoughts meander.<br>
    While others see a mess of symbols and signs,<br>
    He sees a masterpiece, a program that shines.<br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
    He speaks a language, foreign to some,<br>
    Full of brackets, colons, and a dash of fun.<br>
    To understand him, you need the key,<br>
    A passion for logic and a cup of tea.<br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
    He's a master of algorithms, a coder supreme,<br>
    With a knack for turning bugs into a dream.<br>
    His wit is sharp, his humor sublime,<br>
    In the world of programmers, he's one of a kind.<br><br>
  </div>
<div>
  So raise a toast to the programmer's plight,<br>
To late-night coding sessions and debugging fights.<br>
For in the realm of code, where logic does reign,<br>
The programmer's wit shall forever entertain.<br>
</div>
